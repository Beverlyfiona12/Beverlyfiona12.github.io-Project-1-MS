<i><h2>About us</h2></i>
<div>
    <p style="color: brown;">
        Fifi cafe is an, innovative food & beverage outlet located in the heart of Nairobi-
        in Karen. This modern Kenyan bistro concept was inspired by the love of brewing authentic coffee 
        . Fifi cafe represents simplicity, smooth and contemporary vibes and we aim to bring 
        locally-sourced premium-grade coffee, teas, dranks and funky eats to the local and expat 
        community at a not-so-extravagant rate. Also, our cyclical Kenyan-inspired menu and  unique 
        ambience is a must-try experience for those in search for a chilled environment to catch up 
        with their family, friends or colleagues in the day-time, but also for the funky cats who wanna
         get up to no good when the sun goes down. Welcome to The Moovment!
